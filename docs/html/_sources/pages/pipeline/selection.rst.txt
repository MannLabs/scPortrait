Selection
==========

Based on their classification results, individual cells can be selected for isolation by laser microdissection, allowing further analysis. In pooled genetic screening with SPARCS, this enables the identification of genotypes associated with a particular image-based phenotype. Fully automated laser microdissection of selected cells is facilitated by our `py-lmd <https://github.com/MannLabs/py-lmd>`_ library.
