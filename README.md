![Graphical Abstract](https://github.com/MannLabs/SPARCSspatial/assets/15019107/47461f35-3dec-4aa6-ba51-ee1b631ddab9)

SPARCSpy is a scalable toolkit to analyse SPARCS datasets. The python implementation efficiently segments individual cells, generates single-cell datasets and provides tools for the efficient deep learning classification of their phenotypes for downstream applications.

To better understand what SPARCSpy can do please checkout our [documentation](https://mannlabs.github.io/SPARCSpy/html/index.html), the [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.01.542416v1) or our [tweetorial on the computation tools](https://twitter.com/SophiaMaedler/status/1665816840726085634?s=20) and our [tweetorial on the science](https://twitter.com/niklas_a_s/status/1664538053744947203?s=20).

## Documentation

The current documentation can be found under https://mannlabs.github.io/SPARCSspatial/html/index.html.

## Installation from Github

SPARCSpy has been tested with **Python 3.8 and 3.9**. We recommended installing the library within a conda environment. 

To install the SPARCSpy library clone the Github repository and use pip to install the library in your current environment.
Please make sure that the package is installed editable (with the `-e` flag). Otherwise pretrained models might not be available.

We recommend installing the non-python dependencies with conda before installing SPARCSpy (especially if running on an M1 Silicon Mac):

```
git clone https://github.com/MannLabs/SPARCSpy
cd SPARCSpy

conda create -n "SPARCSpy"
conda activate SPARCSpy
conda install python=3.9 scipy 'scikit-image>=0.19' scikit-fmm cellpose opencv numba mahotas -c conda-forge
```

In case you wish to utilize the ML capabilities of SPARCSpy (either for segmentation or classification) please follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to install pytorch correctly for your operating system. Once this has been installed you can verify that pytorch is installed correctly by executing the following python code:

```
import torch
x = torch.rand(5, 3)
print(x)
```
You can access the python console by typing `python` and exit it when you are finished by entering `exit()`.
The output should look something like this:

```
tensor([[0.3380, 0.3845, 0.3217],
 [0.8337, 0.9050, 0.2650],
 [0.2979, 0.7141, 0.9069],
 [0.1449, 0.1132, 0.1375],
 [0.4675, 0.3947, 0.1426]])
```

Once you have installed pytorch according to the instructions we still need to install pytorch lightning. To do this run:

```
conda install -c conda-forge pytorch-lightning
```

Currently SPARCSpy depends on a developer version of alphabase so please install the package from source by doing the following:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/MannLabs/alphabase
```

SPARCSpy also depends on the [py-lmd](https://github.com/MannLabs/py-lmd) library. So please install the py-lmd library into the same conda environment following the installation instructions [here](https://mannlabs.github.io/py-lmd/html/pages/quickstart.html#installation-from-github).

Once these steps are completed you can proceed to install the SPARCSpy package via pip:

```
pip install -e .
```
  

## Citing our Work

SPARCSpy was created by Georg Wallmann, Sophia MÃ¤dler and Niklas Schmacke in the labs of [Matthias Mann](https://www.biochem.mpg.de/de/mann) and [Veit Hornung](https://www.genzentrum.uni-muenchen.de/research-groups/hornung/index.html) in 2023.
SPARCSpy is actively developed with support from the labs of Matthias Mann, Veit Hornung and [Fabian Theis](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en/icb/research-groups/theis-lab).
