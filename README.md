scPortrait is a scalable toolkit to generate single-cell representations from raw microscopy images.

## Getting started

Please refer to our [documentation](https://mannlabs.github.io/scPortrait/), in particular:

- [Introduction](https://mannlabs.github.io/scPortrait/pages/workflow.html)
- [Tutorials](https://mannlabs.github.io/scPortrait/pages/tutorials.html)

## Installation from Github

Check out the docs for [complete installation instructions](https://mannlabs.github.io/scPortrait/pages/installation.html). scPortrait currently supports Python 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12.

To get started you can install scPortrait via pip:

```
pip install scportrait
```

### Limitations

Currently the scPortrait framework is being developed using Linux and macOS, and only provides limited Windows support. Please refer to this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/MannLabs/scPortrait/issues/28) for more information.

## Citing our Work

scPortrait was created by Sophia Mädler, Niklas Schmacke and Georg Wallmann in the labs of [Matthias Mann](https://www.biochem.mpg.de/de/mann), [Veit Hornung](https://www.genzentrum.uni-muenchen.de/research-groups/hornung/index.html) and [Fabian Theis](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en/icb/research-groups/theis-lab) in 2024 and is actively being developed. If you are interested in contributing please reach out to the developers.
