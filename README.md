scPortrait is a scalable toolkit to generate single-cell representations from raw microscopy images.

## Getting started

Please refer to our [documentation](https://mannlabs.github.io/scPortrait/html/index.html) in particular:

- [getting started](https://mannlabs.github.io/scPortrait/html/index.html)
- [example notebooks](https://mannlabs.github.io/scPortrait/html/index.html)

## Installation from Github

Check out the docs for more complete installation instructions. scPortrait currently supports python 3.10 and 3.11.

To get started you can install via pip:

```
pip install git+https://github.org/MannLabs/scPortrait
```

### Limitations

Currently the scPortrait framework is being developed using Linux and macOS and only provides limited Windows support. Please refer to this [git issue](https://github.com/MannLabs/scPortrait/issues/28) for more information.

## Citing our Work

scPortrait was created by Sophia Mädler and Niklas Schmacke in the labs of [Matthias Mann](https://www.biochem.mpg.de/de/mann), [Veit Hornung](https://www.genzentrum.uni-muenchen.de/research-groups/hornung/index.html) and [Fabian Theis](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en/icb/research-groups/theis-lab) in 2024 and is actively being developed. If you are interested in contributing please reach out to the developers.
